      # Ensures that new constraints are created with the `not_valid: true` option.
      #
      # This cop checks database migration files for `add_foreign_key` and
      # `add_constraint` operations to ensure that new constraints are created
      # with the `not_valid: true` option, which is necessary for deferred validation.
      #
      # This cop can be configured to exclude or include specific tables through
      # the `ExcludeTables` and `IncludeTables` options.
      #
      # By using the not_valid: true option, the constraint is created but not enforced
      # on existing data. This allows the database to continue operating normally without
      # the overhead of immediate validation. You can then validate the existing data
      # in a controlled manner using a separate process or during off-peak hours,
      # minimizing the impact on your applicationâ€™s performance. This approach ensures
      # that the new constraint is applied to new data immediately while providing
      # flexibility in handling existing data, promoting better performance and
      # stability during schema changes. Also it is a good

      #   add_foreign_key :users, :orders, column: :user_id, not_valid: true
      #
      #   # bad
      #   alter_table :users do
      #     add_constraint(:user_email_check) { "email IS NOT NULL" }
